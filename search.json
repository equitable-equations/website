    "text": "Equitable Equations March 2020 – Present\n\nMy YouTube channel, Equitable Equations, began in the late winter of 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic forced professors and teachers around the world to move their courses online. Rather than lecturing live via Zoom to students in crises, I made the decision to create bite-sized, modular lessons that could be re-used across semesters and even institutions.\nEverything was very ad hoc for me back then, but I’ve learned a ton since and upgraded my production values substantially. These days, Equitable Equations specializes in #Rstats and closely-related topics in machine learning and computer science and boasts well over 40,000 subscribers. My most popular video, ridiculously titled Learn R in 39 minutes, has nearly a million views. All of this is very strange to me.\n\n\nIn the spring of 2025, in part reflecting my growing understanding of YouTube’s Almighty Algorithm, I made the decision to begin a second channel which would offer full courses in statistics and machine learning, allowing Equitable Equations to focus more specifically on R. Normal Knowledge soft-launched that May, with a more official release coming soon."

Recently, I’ve spoken with Meghan Harris about version control, Abigail Haddad about job hunting in data science, Heather Mattie about ethical AI in healthcare. I love being around people smarter than I am!"

The University of the Virgin Islands is an HBCU and the only degree-offering institution of higher learning in the Virgin Islands. As such, it serves an astounding variety of students, from elite high schoolers to working parents with little memory of earlier math classes. I miss that place every day.\nAs a math professor in an island community of under 40,000 people, I didn’t have the luxury of staying within the narrow specialization of my Ph.D work. I interfaced with the local high schools, taught in a Masters of Arts programs for in-service math teachers, supported a major oceanographic grant (VI-EPSCoR), and provided statistical and mathematical support to a wide variety of projects.\nAlthough I was already transitioning to statistics and R programming during my time at UVI, my research remained true to my Ph.D in pure mathematics. Toward the end of my tenure there, I published my most widely-read paper, The Wild Goose Chase Problem, in 2018 in the Journal of the American Mathematical Association. To this day, I still occasionally engage with pursuit/evasion problems and other differential games in my research."

Such a constraint can be viewed as modeling surface tension in a physical medium such as the red blood cell.\nThough I tutored student athletes as a side hustle, I somehow didn’t attend a single OSU football game during this time.
