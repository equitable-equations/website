## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. Hi everybody!

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

We can make our own code chunks with the green "c" button:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
erykah <- read_excel("erykah.xlsx")
glimpse(erykah)
```

A few Quarto best-practices:

-   don't include interactive commands like `View` and `install.packages` into quarto docs.

-   Always make your docs self-contained.
