I'm generally ambivalent about large language models, but that doesn't mean I'm going to bury my head in the sand about them. This week I learned how to assign Chat a specific role, require that it respond in the style (here, `tidyverse`) that I want, and place limitations on its behavior. All of this isn't generally possible in a browser-based interface, which sent me even deeper into the ellmer package. It's actually *more* fun when you understand how these things work. 

As usual, code and other supporting materials are available below the vid.
