(This page is under construction. Please excuse the mess.)

In addition to teaching full-time, maintaining two YouTube channels, and consulting part-time, I publish consistently in data science and mathematics, often with undergraduate collaborators. Papers behind paywalls can always be downloaded for free from my [GitHub](https://github.com/equitable-equations).
