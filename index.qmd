Hi everybody! I'm a professor at Lake Forest College, just outside of Chicago, USA, where I teach data science and do all sort of cool research, particularly in quantitative botany. I'm somehow also a successful YouTuber, with channels focused on R programming ([Equitable Equations](ee.qmd)) and statics and machine learning ([Normal Knowledge](nk.qmd)). Poke around this site to learn more and connect with me using the links below.

This site is under heavy construction. Please excuse the dust and come back soon to see the finished product!
