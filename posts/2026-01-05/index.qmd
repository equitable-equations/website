The world of data visualization has been revolutionized in recent years
with the introduction of the grammar of graphics and its
implementation in R, the `ggplot2` package. While other plotting systems
set aside a different function for each sort of visualization
(histogram, scatterplot, and so on), the grammar of graphics takes the
view that the most fundamental characteristics of a plot are the
variables it includes and the roles they play (x-axis, y-axis, color,
etc). The specific brand of plot is secondary and can be specified
later.

To create a visualization, we need to specify three things:

1.  what [**data**]{.underline} is being used.

2.  how the variables are [**mapped**]{.underline} onto the plot (in
    this case, onto the x- and y-axes).

3.  which [**geometry**]{.underline} should be used to represent the
    data (scatter plot, line graph, or something else entirely).

Design considerations like axis labels, color palette, and font, can be specified separately after the fact

Notice how all of these elements appear, in order, in the following code chunk.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_len, y = body_mass)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
