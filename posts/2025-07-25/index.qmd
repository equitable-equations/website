The phrase "advanced counting" is bringing me an unreasonable amount of joy today. No, I don't just mean listing really big whole numbers (though actually that could be pretty cool, too). The newest upload to my stats-focused channel, [Normal Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/@NormalKnowledgeAG), features 4 challenging enumeration problems, including this nugget: how many distinct rolls of 12 dice are possible when the order of the rolls doesnâ€™t matter? Listen, the world is in a state, and I'm finding joy wherever I can.

The vid isn't officially released yet, but you can watch it here if you like:
