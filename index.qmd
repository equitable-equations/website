Hi everybody! I'm a professor at Lake Forest College, just outside of Chicago, USA, where I teach data science and do research in quantitative botany and other areas. I'm somehow also a successful YouTuber, with channels focused on R programming ([Equitable Equations](ee.qmd)) and statics and machine learning ([Normal Knowledge](nk.qmd)). Poke around this site to learn more and connect with me using the links below.
