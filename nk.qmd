(This page is under construction. Please excuse the mess.)

My new YouTube channel, currently under construction, will offer complete courses on statistics and machine learning. Currently available:

- [Normal Knowledge College Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqA7RLX4UP3ivlA7dd7osTYESwGaSNRhg)

Always free, but proceeds from ads and tips (thanks in advance!) benefit the cool charities.
