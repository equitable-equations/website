    "section": "",
    "text": "While all you really need to start a channel is a computer (or even just a phone), some upgrades can make a huge difference.\n\nMicrophone: A decent microphone is the first purchase you should make when you start to get serious about your YouTube channel (or your podcast, TikTok account, or whatever). Nothing makes a viewer click away faster than poor sound quality. I currently use a Shure MV-7, but also had great results with a Rode NT-USB mini (only about $100!). A boom arm with shock mount is a good low-cost add-on.\nVideo sizing: YouTube strongly prefers an aspect ratio of 16:9, though the screen on MacBooks (like my Air) is 16:10. In order to make everything match up, I use SwitchResX to force my Mac into the necessary resolution before recording my screen.\nRecording and editing: I used OBS Studio (which is free) without complaints for my first two years, but Camtasia was a huge quality of life upgrade. It records my face, screen, and audio on separate tracks, then provides user-friendly tools for editing and combining the various elements. I keep recording when I get tongue-tied now, backing up only to the start of my thought and then deleting the embarrassing stuff later on, usually with a smooth fade from one clip to the other.\nLogo and thumbnails: Anyone will tell you that quality thumbnails are absolutely essential for attracting viewers. If you’re just starting out, I recommend starting with a template like those offered by Adobe, Canva, and many others. After my channel monetized, I contracted a designer (Tiara Wiggins at Twiggs Creative) to professionalize my channel. I strongly recommend an experienced human over AI or DIY options.\nIntro and end screens: Canva offers free tools for animating images. I started with my logo, then wiped it in and out. With a little tinkering, you can probably do even better. I think the results are pretty good, but will ultimately bring in professional help to improve this, too.\nSlides: I’m old school, for better and for worse. Usually my slides are made with LaTeX, which reflects my background in pure mathematics. I also occasionally use PowerPoint and Quarto. None of these are especially engaging, I’m sure, but they’re what I know and they’re at least appropriate to material that I cover.\nGraphics: My data-oriented visualizations are made in R, usually with ggplot2, while more algebraic plots (like density curves) are generally done in Geogebra. All of this is free.\n\nThere’s a lot more to YouTube than just hitting “record” and talking to the camera. It’s been a long learning curve for me, and I hope yours will be shorter. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn if you have questions!"

Rather than lecturing live via Zoom to students in crises, I made the decision to create bite-sized, modular lessons that could be re-used across semesters and even institutions.\nEverything was very ad hoc for me back then, but I’ve learned a ton since and upgraded my production values substantially. These days, Equitable Equations specializes in #Rstats and closely-related topics in machine learning and computer science and boasts well over 40,000 subscribers. My most popular video, ridiculously titled Learn R in 39 minutes, has nearly a million views. All of this is very strange to me.\n\n\nIn the spring of 2025, in part reflecting my growing understanding of YouTube’s Almighty Algorithm, I made the decision to begin a second channel which would offer full courses in statistics and machine learning, allowing Equitable Equations to focus more specifically on R. Normal Knowledge soft-launched that May, with a more official release coming soon."

As such, it serves an astounding variety of students, from elite high schoolers to working parents with little memory of earlier math classes. I miss that place every day.\nAs a math professor in an island community of under 40,000 people, I didn’t have the luxury of staying within the narrow specialization of my Ph.D work. I interfaced with the local high schools, taught in a Masters of Arts programs for in-service math teachers, supported a major oceanographic grant (VI-EPSCoR), and provided statistical and mathematical support to a wide variety of projects.\nAlthough I was already transitioning to statistics and R programming during my time at UVI, my research remained true to my Ph.D in pure mathematics. Toward the end of my tenure there, I published my most widely-read paper, The Wild Goose Chase Problem, in 2018 in the Journal of the American Mathematical Association. To this day, I still occasionally engage with pursuit/evasion problems and other differential games in my research."

    "text": "Ohio Wesleyan University August 2012 – May 2014\n\nFollowing completion of my doctorate in mathematics from Ohio State University, I was hired as a visiting assistant professor at OWU, in part to replace their statistics prof, who was away on sabbatical. I taught stats at the freshman and sophomore levels for two years, beginning my R career and starting to come to grips with the fact that pure math might not be my calling after all.\nDuring that time, I organized and chaired the Midstates Conference of Undergraduate Research in Computer Science and Mathematics (MCURCSM). Papers for this conference underwent academic peer-review as part of the acceptance process, which I organized via the EasyChair management system. I also edited and published the conference proceedings."

    "text": "The Ohio State University Ph.D. mathematics, March 2012\n I did my graduate work at OSU, where I completed a doctoral thesis entitled Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities in \\(R^3\\), under the supervision of Dr. Fangyang Zheng. Roughly speaking, this problem considered surfaces of minimal area for fixed volume under curvature constraints. Such a constraint can be viewed as modeling surface tension in a physical medium such as the red blood cell.\nThough I tutored student athletes as a side hustle, I somehow didn’t attend a single OSU football game during this time. Don’t hate me if you’re from Michigan, please."

    "text": "Previous experience \nI tried on a number of different hats before starting graduate school, some relevant to my current work, some not. I reviewed books for the Columbus Dispatch and Cleveland Plain Dealer back when local newspapers were a thing. I was a part-time data analyst for a public-opinion research company. I sat on the board of a small preschool. I worked nights at a Red Roof Inn (ask me about that one if you see me). And I played bass in an indie rock band for awhile.\nThe cliche goes that life is short, but this hasn’t been my experience. Life is long, and there’s time enough to be different people over time if have the desire and your circumstances allow. All of those people live within me now, chattering away inside a modestly wise, very nerdy, middle aged head."
