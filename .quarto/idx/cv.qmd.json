Initially hired at the assistant level, I have since been promoted to associate professor with tenure. \n\nIn this role, I spearhead the statistics track of the DS major, focusing on R programming and mathematical probability/statistics. Because my Ph.D is in pure mathematics, I'm able to support students with that focus as well, teaching and mentoring all levels of undergraduate math.\n\nA few of the many research projects I've mentored in my time here:\n\n* _Enhancing visual accessibility in Lake Forest College's data science major_, with Tobias Ellis. Summer 2024.\n\n* _Hypoxia reversal improves antimalarial immune response_, with Kateryna Malkina. Academic year 2023-2024.\n\n* _Investigating co-occurrence in Chicagoland floristic quality assessments_, with Irene Lulabelwa and Ryan Sorrells. Summer 2023 James Rocco fellowship.\n\n* _Using machine learning to detect the presence of the onchocerca parasite_, with Jovana Jovanovska. Academic year 2022-2023.\n\n* _Developing quantitative tools for floristic quality assessment_, with Alexia Myers. Summer 2022.\n\n* _Uncertainty in SIR epidemiological models_, with Kateryna Malkina. Summer 2022.\n\n* _The lion-and-man problem in the hyperbolic disk_, with Dipika Subramaniam. Academic year 2020-2021. \n\n* _Prediction intervals for interpolants_, with Ethan Wilson. Summer 2020 Richter scholars program.\n\nSeveral of these projects have led to peer-reviewed publications with undergraduate collaborators. For specifics, take a look at a complete list of my [publications](pubs.qmd).\n\n## Equitable Equations [March 2020 -- Present]{.cv-date}\n\n![](assets/logo_transparent.png){style=\"float: right; margin: 5px;\" width=140}\n\nMy YouTube channel, *Equitable Equations*, began in the late winter of 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic forced professors and teachers around the world to move their courses online. Rather than lecturing live via Zoom to students in crises, I made the decision to create bite-sized, modular lessons that could be re-used across semesters and even institutions. \n\nEverything was very ad hoc for me back then, but I've learned a ton since and upgraded my production values substantially. These days, Equitable Equations specializes in #Rstats and closely-related topics in machine learning and computer science and boasts well over 40,000 subscribers. My most popular video, ridiculously titled *Learn R in 39 minutes*, has nearly a million views. All of this is very strange to me.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZ0bV2Afkjc?si=kJ6yF34-1ZChKtfI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn the spring of 2025, in part reflecting my growing understanding of YouTube's Almighty Algorithm, I made the decision to begin a second channel which would offer full courses in statistics and machine learning, allowing *Equitable Equations* to focus more specifically on R. [Normal Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/@NormalKnowledgeAG) soft-launched that May, with a more official release coming soon. \n\n## Collaboration []{.cv-date}\n\nThe best part of running Equitable Equations has been the opportunity to meet and work with some immensely talented and kindhearted people, particularly in the #Rstats community. Together with Dr. Greg Martin, proprietor of R Programming 101, I co-host a YouTube series called \"Today I learned in R,\" where the two of us (and sometimes guests) open up about some of the many discoveries we're constantly making as our data science skills continue to evolve. \n\nOn my own channel, I make it a point to bring in experts to weigh in on the real-world considerations of the topics I cover. Recently, I've spoken with Meghan Harris about version control, Abigail Haddad about job hunting in data science, Heather Mattie about ethical AI in healthcare. I love being around people smarter than I am!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t07CrmPJVog?si=0MicM_K8gpmkDm74\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The University of the Virgin Islands [August 2014 -- May 2019]{.cv-date}\n\n![](assets/uvi_logo2.jpg){style=\"float: right; margin: 5px;\" width=140}\n\n\nPrior to moving to Chicago, I worked as a professor of mathematics on the island of St. Croix, USVI. The University of the Virgin Islands is an HBCU and the only degree-offering institution of higher learning in the Virgin Islands. As such, it serves an astounding variety of students, from elite high schoolers to working parents with little memory of earlier math classes. I miss that place every day. \n\nAs a math professor in an island community of under 40,000 people, I didn't have the luxury of staying within the narrow specialization of my Ph.D work. I interfaced with the local high schools, taught in a Masters of Arts programs for in-service math teachers, supported a major oceanographic grant (VI-EPSCoR), and provided statistical and mathematical support to a wide variety of projects. \n\nAlthough I was already transitioning to statistics and R programming during my time at UVI, my research remained true to my Ph.D in pure mathematics. Toward the end of my tenure there, I published my most widely-read paper, *The Wild Goose Chase Problem*, in 2018 in the Journal of the American Mathematical Association. To this day, I still occasionally engage with pursuit/evasion problems and other differential games in my research.\n\n## Ohio Wesleyan University [August 2012 -- May 2014]{.cv-date}\n\n![](assets/owu_logo.png){style=\"float: right; margin: 5px;\" width=140}\n\nFollowing completion of my doctorate in mathematics from Ohio State University, I was hired as a visiting assistant professor at OWU, in part to replace their statistics prof, who was away on sabbatical.

Such a constraint can be viewed as modeling surface tension in a physical medium such as the red blood cell. \n\nThough I tutored student athletes as a side hustle, I somehow didn't attend a single OSU football game during this time.
